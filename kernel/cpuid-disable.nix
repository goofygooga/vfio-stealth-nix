# CPUID interception disable patch (postPatch script)
#
# Clears INTERCEPT_CPUID in init_vmcb so the guest executes CPUID at
# native hardware speed with zero VM exit overhead. The CPU returns
# real hardware values (AuthenticAMD, no hypervisor bit) because the
# host IS an AMD CPU and the hypervisor-present bit is synthetic
# (only set by KVM via interception, absent in real hardware CPUID).
#
# On AMD SVM, VMRUN loads guest XCR0 from the VMCB before guest
# execution, so CPUID leaf 0xD returns XSAVE sizes consistent with
# the guest's active XCR0. No XCR0 synchronization is needed.
#
# Defeats VMAware TIMER (95pts) and SINGLE_STEP (100pts) techniques:
# both measure CPUID execution timing via software counters or #DB
# traps. Without a VM exit, CPUID runs at native speed — identical
# to bare metal.
#
# Side effects:
# - Hyper-V enlightenments (hypervclock, vapic, etc.) are invisible
#   to the guest since KVM can't inject CPUID leaves without interception.
#   Windows falls back to TSC (fine with tsc=reliable + invariant TSC).
# - kvm.hidden has no effect on CPUID (unnecessary — hardware doesn't
#   expose hypervisor). KVM MSR enforcement still works via
#   kvm-pv-enforce-cpuid=on (uses internal CPUID table, not interception).
# - The Hypervisor-Phantom patch (cpuid-patch.nix) becomes a no-op if
#   both are applied — CPUID never exits, so the spoof never fires.
#
# Stability: init_vmcb sets intercepts once for non-nested operation.
# Nested SVM (enter_svm_guest_mode) can re-set intercepts, but a
# Windows gaming VM never enables nested virtualization. Belt-and-
# suspenders: we also clear in pre_svm_run to catch any future
# kernel path that might re-enable INTERCEPT_CPUID.
#
# Limitation: hypercall patching (timing-patch.nix step 9) is host-
# wide — ALL VMs get #UD for VMCALL/VMMCALL from ring 3. Linux guests
# on this host lose KVM paravirt features (kvmclock, PV TLB flush).
# This is acceptable for a single-purpose gaming VM host.
